Input format for COW/DeReKo topic modelling


=== GENERAL ===

– XML with inline VRT
– well-formed UTF-8 (check with isutf8)
– required attributes are listed here
– corpus, doc, div, s can have arbitrary additional attributes
  which are ignored by default
– XML markup must be on single lines per tag
– lines not starting with < are considered VRT
– lemma is "(unknown)" if TreeTagger + COW additions do not
  know the word
- doc_id is an MD5 hash (typically of the URL or other
  identifier) suffixed with 4 random hex digits

=== Tagger models ===
